                <p>Performance tuning is the improvement of system performance. Typically, in computer systems, the motivation for such activity is called a performance problem, which can be either real or anticipated. Most systems will respond to increased load with some degree of decreasing performance. A system's ability to accept higher load is called scalability, and modifying a system to handle a higher load is synonymous to performance tuning.</p>

                <p>An RPA approach to streamline internal processes, where people and technology work together in harmony, enables better insight into trends and opportunities for businesses.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) works best with rule-based, regular tasks that require manual inputs. As the software robot uses other application UIs, very few modifications, if any are required to implement the automation.</p>
                <br />
                <ul class="Bullet-for-RTE">
                    <p>
                        Here are the top 5 benefits of implementing RPA software for your company.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Reduced cost: By automating tasks, cost savings of nearly 30% can be achieved. Software robots also cost less than a full-time employee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Better customer experience: Deploying RPA frees up your high-value resources to be put back on the front line ensuring your customer success.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lower operational risk: By eliminating human errors such as tiredness or lack of knowledge, RPA reduces the rate of errors thereby providing a lower level of operational risk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improved internal processes: In order to leverage AI and RPA, companies are forced to define clear governance procedures. This, in turn, allows for faster internal reporting, on-boarding and other internal activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It does not replace existing IT systems: One of the biggest advantages of using a virtual workforce, or an RPA bot is that it does not require you to replace your existing systems. Instead, RPA can leverage your existing systems, the same way a human employee can.
                    </li>

                <p>Most professional services firms use a leveraging system to maximize profitability. For instance, junior employees usually earn a relatively low salary. They accept lower pay because they want to gain experience and have the opportunity to work closely with senior partners ("finders") to acquire their valuable knowledge.</p>
