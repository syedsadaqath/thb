                <p>Research and development – R&D – are the process by which a company works to create new technology, products, services, or systems that it will either use or sell. Along with creating new products and adding features to old ones, investing in R&D connects various parts of a company's strategy and business plan, such as marketing and cost reduction.</p><br>
                <p>R&D (Research & Development) plays a very important role in the success of a business. Every failure in a R&D effort increases the pressure to perform. R&D helps a business to have a competitive edge over its competitors. It is the R&D function that develops plans much ahead other functions.</p>

                <p>Performance tuning is the improvement of system performance. Typically, in computer systems, the motivation for such activity is called a performance problem, which can be either real or anticipated. Most systems will respond to increased load with some degree of decreasing performance. A system's ability to accept higher load is called scalability, and modifying a system to handle a higher load is synonymous to performance tuning.</p>
